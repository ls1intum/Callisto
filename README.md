### Empowering Developers with a Dynamic User Interface for GitHub Actions

Welcome to the GitHub Actions UI Enhancement project! This project aims to develop a web application that enhances the usability of GitHub Actions by providing a dynamic user interface for developers. The application addresses key limitations such as the absence of a graphical interface, challenges in visualizing deployment targets, test case failures, and flaky tests.
